3. Clear the shop's TMP folder

## Configuration

The following parameters can be adjusted using these variables:

| Setting                  | Description                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| oxlogiq_httpApiEndpoint  | *optional:* Http API endpoint (e.g. for ElasticSearch / ELK Stack)                                             |
